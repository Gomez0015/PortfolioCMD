# React Terminal Portfolio!

Credits to: https://github.com/nitin42/terminal-in-react for the awsome library!

At the same time that I am building my portfolio I am creating a small but fun plugin for this module, 
will be a CTF plugin allowing you to hide flags in the terminal and even establish ssh connections!
